/* The context is statically allocated in single-threaded builds, dynamically
   allocated in multi-threaded shared builds using malloc, and allocated using
   multiple thread locals in multi-threaded static builds.

   - Single-threaded: Making global variables enables the compiler to remove
     the extra level of indirection in the case of the single-threaded build.
   - Multi-threaded(shared): Having a single thread local enables the compiler
     to group TLS accesses (reduces __tls_get_addr calls.)
   - Multi-threaded(static): Having context split into multiple thread locals
     enables the compiler to optimise TLS accesses into the least number of
     instructions (negligible difference in performance from single-threaded
     build). */
