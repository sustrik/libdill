.SH NAME

tls_done \- half\-closes a TLS protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <libdill.h>

int\ tls_done(
\ \ \ \ int\ s,
\ \ \ \ int64_t\ deadline);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]WARNING: This is experimental functionality and the API may change
in the future.\f[]
.PP
TLS is a cryptographic protocol to provide secure communication over the
network.
It is a bytestream protocol.
.PP
This function closes the outbound half of TLS connection.
This will, in turn, cause the peer to get \f[B]EPIPE\f[] error after it
has received all the data.
.PP
\f[B]s\f[]: The TLS connection handle.
.PP
\f[B]deadline\f[]: A point in time when the operation should time out,
in milliseconds.
Use the \f[B]now\f[] function to get your current point in time.
0 means immediate timeout, i.e., perform the operation if possible or
return without blocking if not.
\-1 means no deadline, i.e., the call will block forever if the
operation cannot be performed.
.PP
This function is not available if libdill is compiled with
\f[B]\-\-disable\-sockets\f[] option.
.PP
This function is not available if libdill is compiled without
\f[B]\-\-enable\-tls\f[] option.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
In case of success the function returns 0.
In case of error it returns \-1 and sets \f[B]errno\f[] to one of the
values below.
.SH ERRORS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]EBADF\f[]: Invalid handle.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ECANCELED\f[]: Current coroutine was canceled.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ENOTSUP\f[]: The handle does not support this operation.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]EPIPE\f[]: The connection was already half\-closed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ETIMEDOUT\f[]: Deadline was reached.
