#include\ <libdill.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
IPC protocol is a bytestream protocol for transporting data among
processes on the same machine.
It is an equivalent to POSIX \f[B]AF_LOCAL\f[] sockets.
.PP
This function creates a connection to a remote IPC endpoint.
.PP
This function allows to avoid one dynamic memory allocation by storing
the object in user\-supplied memory.
Unless you are hyper\-optimizing use \f[B]ipc_connect\f[] instead.
.PP
\f[B]addr\f[]: Filename to connect to.
.PP
\f[B]mem\f[]: The structure to store the newly created object in.
It must not be deallocated before the object is closed.
.PP
\f[B]deadline\f[]: A point in time when the operation should time out,
in milliseconds.
Use the \f[B]now\f[] function to get your current point in time.
0 means immediate timeout, i.e., perform the operation if possible or
return without blocking if not.
\-1 means no deadline, i.e., the call will block forever if the
operation cannot be performed.
.PP
The socket can be cleanly shut down using \f[B]ipc_close\f[] function.
.PP
This function is not available if libdill is compiled with
\f[B]\-\-disable\-sockets\f[] option.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
In case of success the function returns newly created socket handle.
In case of error it returns \-1 and sets \f[B]errno\f[] to one of the
values below.
.SH ERRORS
.IP \[bu] 2

.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ECANCELED\f[]: Current coroutine was canceled.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ECONNREFUSED\f[]: The target address was not listening for
connections or refused the connection request.
.IP \[bu] 2

.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]EINVAL\f[]: Invalid argument.
.IP \[bu] 2

are already open.
.IP \[bu] 2

\f[B]NAME_MAX\f[] characters, or an entire pathname exceeded
\f[B]PATH_MAX\f[] characters.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ENFILE\f[]: The maximum number of file descriptors in the system
are already open.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ENOENT\f[]: A component of the pathname does not name an existing
file or the pathname is an empty string.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ENOMEM\f[]: Not enough memory.
.IP \[bu] 2

address is not a directory.
