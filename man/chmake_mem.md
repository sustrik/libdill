# NAME

chmake_mem - create a channel in user-supplied memory

# SYNOPSIS

**#include &lt;libdill.h>**

**struct chmem;**

**int chmake_mem(size_t **_itemsz_**, struct chmem **\*_mem_**);**

# DESCRIPTION

Creates a channel in user-supplied memory.

_itemsz_ is the byte size of the items to be sent through the channel.

_mem_ is the memory to store channel data in. The memory must not be deallocated before all handles referring to the channel are closed with the **hclose** function, or the behaviour is undefined.

Do not use this function unless you are hyper-optimising your code and you want to avoid a single memory allocation per channel. Whenever possible, use **chmake** instead.

The channel is a synchronizationn primitive, not a container. It doesn't store any items.

# RETURN VALUE

Returns a channel handle. In the case of an error, it returns -1 and sets _errno_ to one of the values below.

# ERRORS

* **ECANCELED**: Current coroutine is in the process of shutting down.
* **EINVAL**: Invalid parameter.

# EXAMPLE

```c
struct chitem {
    int h;
    struct chmem mem;
};

struct chitem *alloc_channels(size_t n) {
    struct chitem *a = malloc(sizeof(struct chitem) * n);
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i != n; ++i)
        a[i].h = chmake_mem(0, &a[i].mem);
    return a;
}

void free_channels(struct chitem *a, size_t n) {
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i != n; ++i)
        hclose(a[i].h);
    free(a);
}
```
