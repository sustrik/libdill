\f[C]
#include\ <libdill.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function receives data from a bytestream socket.
It is a blocking operation that unblocks only after the requested amount
of data is received.
There is no such thing as partial receive.
If a problem, including timeout, occurs while receiving the data, an
error is returned to the user and the socket cannot be used for
receiving from that point on.
.PP
If \f[B]buf\f[] is \f[B]NULL\f[], \f[B]len\f[] bytes will be received
but they will be dropped rather than returned to the user.
.PP
\f[B]s\f[]: The socket.
.PP
\f[B]buf\f[]: Buffer to receive the data to.
.PP
\f[B]len\f[]: Size of the buffer, in bytes.
.PP
\f[B]deadline\f[]: A point in time when the operation should time out,
in milliseconds.
Use the \f[B]now\f[] function to get your current point in time.
0 means immediate timeout, i.e., perform the operation if possible or
return without blocking if not.
\-1 means no deadline, i.e., the call will block forever if the
operation cannot be performed.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
In case of success the function returns 0.
In case of error it returns \-1 and sets \f[B]errno\f[] to one of the
values below.
.SH ERRORS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]EBADF\f[]: Invalid handle.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]EBUSY\f[]: The handle is currently being used by a different
coroutine.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ECANCELED\f[]: Current coroutine was canceled.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ECONNRESET\f[]: Broken connection.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]EINVAL\f[]: Invalid argument.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ENOTSUP\f[]: The handle does not support this operation.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]EPIPE\f[]: Closed connection.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ETIMEDOUT\f[]: Deadline was reached.
