http_done \- half\-closes a HTTP connection
.SH SYNOPSIS

int\ http_done(
\ \ \ \ int\ s,
\ \ \ \ int64_t\ deadline);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]WARNING: This is experimental functionality and the API may change
in the future.\f[]
.PP
HTTP is an application\-level protocol described in RFC 7230.
This implementation handles only the request/response exchange.
Whatever comes after that must be handled by a different protocol.
.PP
This function closes the outbound half of an HTTP connection.
Technically, it sends a blank line to the peer.
This will, in turn, cause the peer to get \f[B]EPIPE\f[] error after it
has received all the data.
.PP
Note that HTTP servers rely on getting a blank line before they send a
response to a request.
Therefore, client, after sending all the fields, must use
\f[B]http_done\f[] to inform the server that it should act upon the
request.
.PP
\f[B]s\f[]: The HTTP connection handle.
.PP
\f[B]deadline\f[]: A point in time when the operation should time out,
in milliseconds.
Use the \f[B]now\f[] function to get your current point in time.
0 means immediate timeout, i.e., perform the operation if possible or
return without blocking if not.
\-1 means no deadline, i.e., the call will block forever if the
operation cannot be performed.
.PP
This function is not available if libdill is compiled with
\f[B]\-\-disable\-sockets\f[] option.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
In case of success the function returns 0.
In case of error it returns \-1 and sets \f[B]errno\f[] to one of the
values below.
.SH ERRORS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]EBADF\f[]: Invalid handle.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ECANCELED\f[]: Current coroutine was canceled.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ENOTSUP\f[]: The handle does not support this operation.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]EPIPE\f[]: The connection was already half\-closed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]ETIMEDOUT\f[]: Deadline was reached.
