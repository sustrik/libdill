# NAME

chsend - send a message to a channel

# SYNOPSIS

**#include &lt;libdill.h>**

**int chsend(int ***ch*, **const void** \*_val_**, size_t **_len_**, int64_t **_deadline_**);**

# DESCRIPTION

Sends a message to a channel. The first parameter is a channel handle. The second one points to a buffer that contains the message to send. The third parameter is the size of the buffer.

The size of the buffer must match the size of the elements stored in the channel as supplied to the **chmake** function.

If there's no receiver for the message, the function waits until one becomes available or until the deadline expires.

_deadline_ is a point in time when the operation should time out. Use the **now()** function to get your current point in time. 0 means immediate timeout, i.e. perform the operation if possible or return without blocking if not. -1 means no deadline, i.e. the call will block forever if the operation cannot be performed.

# RETURN VALUE

The function returns 0 on success. On error, it returns -1 and sets _errno_ to one of the values below.

# ERRORS

* **EBADF**: Invalid handle.
* **ECANCELED**: Current coroutine is being shut down.
* **EINVAL**: Invalid parameter.
* **ENOTSUP**: Operation not supported. Presumably, the handle isn't a channel.
* **EPIPE**: Channel has been closed with **chdone**.
* **ETIMEDOUT**: Deadline expired while waiting on a message.

# EXAMPLE

```c
int val = 42;
chsend(ch, &val, sizeof(val), now() + 1000);
if(result != 0) {
    perror("Cannot send message");
    exit(1);
}
printf("Value %d sent successfully.\n", val);
```
