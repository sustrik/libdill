.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function drops any state that libdill associates with a file
descriptor.
It has to be called before the file descriptor is closed.
If it is not, the behavior is undefined.
.PP
It should also be used whenever you are losing control of the file
descriptor.
For example, when passing it to a third\-party library.
Also, if you are handed the file descriptor by third party code you
should call this function just before returning it back to the original
owner.
.PP
\f[B]fd\f[]: file descriptor (OS\-level one, not a libdill handle)

None.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
None.
